=== List files and browse command line output with ease ===

1. Use ls -ltr (list, time, reverse) to view last edited files

2. Uses less -S to scroll or search command line output

=> ls -ltr | less -S

3. Use the tab key to complete partially written commands

=== Re-using previous commands ===

1. Use the up-key to retrieve previous commands

2. Use Reverse-Interactive search (Ctrl+R) to retrieve previous commands

3. Retrieve previous commands Using the history command

Appendix a. Increase the command history size:

Edit .bashrc

HISTSIZE=10000
HISTFILESIZE=20000

source .bashrc

=== Repeat the same command for many files or lines with xargs and for loops ===

1. Execute command for each output of another command using xargs

ls *.txt | xargs cat

2. Looping over multiple files with for-loops

for file in $(ls *.txt); do echo ""; echo "------ $file ------"; echo ""; cat $file;  done;

=== Use shortcuts to quickly navigate previous commands ===

1. Use Ctrl to jump between words

2. Use HOME and END to quickly jump to the start or end of the command

=== Aliases & Functions ===

Aliases: Save a command as an alias

ls -ltr

alias l='ls -ltr'

=> l

Functions: Take parameters, and do potentially complex things

list() { ls -ltr; }

=> list

list() { ls -ltr $1; }

=> list /

=== Bootstrapping: create an alias to add aliases ===

Creating an alias that:
1. Opens the correct file
2. Jumps to the end of the file
3. Re-loads ('sources') the file after saving

Create .bash_aliases
Edit .bash_aliases

alias l='ls -ltr'

source .bash_aliases

=> l

Edit .bash_aliases

alias ea='vim -/.bash_aliases; source -/.bash_aliases;'

source .bash_aliases

=> ea

alias listcurrentfolder='ls'

=> listcurrentfolder

=> ea

alias ea='vim +1000 -/.bash_aliases; source -/.bash_aliases;'

=> ea

listrootfolder() {
  echo "Listing the root folder ...";
  echo "";
  ls /;
}

=> listrootfolder

=== Finding out which commands are most often used ===

Commands used:
- history
- cut /awk
- sort
- uniq

history | cut -c 8-1000 | sort | uniq -c

history | cut -c 8-1000 | sort | uniq -n

=> ea

alias commoncommands='history | cut -c 8-1000 | sort | uniq -n'
